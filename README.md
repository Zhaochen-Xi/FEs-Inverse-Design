This repository contains the source code and datasets for the research paper: "Active learning optimization in latent spaces accelerates inverse design of ferroelectric ceramics for energy storage".
📝 Overview
Simultaneously achieving high energy density and efficiency in ferroelectric ceramics is challenging due to the complex coupling between chemical composition and polarization configuration. Traditional high-throughput exploration is often limited by the computational cost of solving real-time polarization dynamics.This project implements an inverse design framework that integrates a variational generative model with active learning-driven optimization. By formulating the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation as conditional sampling within a latent space, we accelerate the discovery of Bi${0.5}$Na${0.5}$TiO$_3$-based relaxor-ferroelectrics with superior energy storage performance.
